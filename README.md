# WolfAPI

This package converts your Laravel application to an API; it bundles by default all the necessary features to work as an API service.

## How it works

This package provides a set of useful classes and magical utilities to convert your application
into a REST API, providing support by default for Laravel Modules, JWT authentication, user roles and permissions,
custom error handling, and a guaranteed response in JSON.

It's highly recommended that you use Laravel Modules to scaffold your application in order to maintain
a properly organized structure, and allowing you to manage your API easily.

```bash
composer require ignitionwolf/wolf-api
